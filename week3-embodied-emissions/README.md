# Estimating Embodied Emissions

The goal of today is to explore the ‘carbon footprint’ (related to embodied energy) of your own digital appliances and devices that you identified last week. Unlike direct energy use, the energy here is required at all stages of the manufacturing pipeline, so the carbon footprint relates to mining of raw materials, processing, transportation, manufacturing, and all the other items that come together to make your products and get them in your hands.

## Cautionary Note

The carbon footprint of each device is at best an estimate of the average or typical embodied energy, as the supply chains are very long and complex. They also differ between even similar products, and change over time (e.g., a market might source from different suppliers).

1. You may get differences in estimates, or only be able to get an estimate for a device that’s as similar as possible.
2. Sometimes manufacturers and resellers will list the carbon footprint. There are always questions we should ask about whether we can rely on the data - data can be old, contain errors, or it may be in their interest to ‘scope’ the estimate to make their products look good.
3. We may have to start caring more about data quality, e.g., published peer reviews in reputable journals with ‘life cycle assessments’ (LCA) analysis are likely to be the most reliable sources.

Since this is just a short lab task, approximate ‘ball park’ estimates are good enough to ‘get an idea’.

## Task

Time available: 1 hour.

Make sure you have an up to date copy of your coursework repo available (```git clone``` or ```git pull``` as needed to ensure you are up to date with the server), as before. In the ‘week3-embodied-emissions’ folder, create a new markdown document called ```username-week3-labnotes.md```, where ‘username’ is, of course, your username.

1. For each photo that you used last week, put a subheading that describes it.
2. Look up the carbon footprint of the device’s manufacture.
3. Add a table. Bring over the annual energy use of the device based on your use pattern. Add a column converting this to CO2e by multiplying by a conversion factor (take care with your units!). In Slovenia, you can assume the energy mix is [0.235 kg CO2e/kWh](https://ceu.ijs.si/izpusti-co2-tgp-na-enoto-elektricne-energije/)
4. Add a column with the carbon footprint for the device.
5. Now add a column comparing the use footprint with the embodied footprint. Multiply the use footprint by the number of years you keep the device to get the total direct energy for that many years of use; calculate the ‘footprint per year’ of the  manufacturing footprint.
6. You should add a row for 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. In reality, some devices have shorter lifespans than this, but many (e.g., TVs, ovens) could last much longer.
7. Add a subsection ## Reflections with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another, especially reflecting on the use phase related energy against the manufacturing or embodied energy.

**In your report, specify which data sources you used and provide reasons for choosing them.**
Don’t forget to git add your new file, commit, and push to the server at least at the end of the task.

## Example - Estimating Embodied Emissions of a Mobile Phone Device - iPhone 15

Estimated yearly energy use for the device is: 5.573 kWh

To convert energy consumption to CO2 emissions, we need to multiply the energy used (in kilowatt-hours, kWh) by an emission factor specific to the energy source and your location. For example, a simple formula is: Total Energy (kWh) × Emission Factor (kg CO2e/kWh) = Total CO2e Emissions.

2023 Ljubljana: 0.235 kg CO2e/kWh [1]

Therefore, total CO2e emissions for yearly energy use of this mobile phone device are: 1.310 kg CO2e
If we estimate that the device will be used for 5 years (average lifespan [2]), the total CO2e emissions for energy use of the device is 6.55 kg CO2e.

Next, let's estimate the emissions generated by internet use, mobile network transmission, data centers, cloud backups, streaming, or third-party cloud computing used by apps. These are normally treated as separate Scope-3 categories (network & service emissions).

1. Yearly network transmission emissions (internet use, mobile network transmission, and streaming):

- Mobile data traffic per year can be estimated from average monthly use: 35 GB * 12 months ≈ 420 GB
  Energy intensity per GB (kWh/GB) for mobile data transfer is estimated to be 0.14 kWh/GB [3], leading to a total of 58.8 kWh yearly energy consumption on mobile data traffic. If we take Europe's average emission factor of 207 g CO2e/kWh [6], we will arrive at a yearly emission of **12.172 kg CO2e**.

- Video streaming emits 36 g CO2e per hour [4, 5], based on personal usage patterns (35 h/month), average yearly emissions would be **15.12 kg CO2e**.

2. Data center/cloud storage and compute emissions per GB-year estimation is somewhere between 0.04 and 2 kg CO2e (information from [7] seems to be quite old, with newer information [8] giving 0.04 kg CO2e per GB-year). I have 40 GB of data on cloud storage and taking an average of 1 kg CO2e per GB-year for both storage and compute (I could not find any reliable information for compute emissions), my yearly emissions for cloud storage and compute go up to **40 kg CO2e**.

Finally, based on the official Apple information [9], iPhone 15 production is responsible for 44.8 kg CO2e, transportation for 1.68 kg CO2e, and end-of-life processing for 0.56 kg CO2e. If we take 5 years as the average lifespan of the device, the manufacturing footprint per year would be **47.04 kg CO2e**.

| Time span     | Energy consumption | Estimated GHG emission for energy use | Embodied GHG emissions | Manufacturing emissions |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1 year        | 5.573 kWh          | 1.310 kg CO2e                         | 67.292 kg CO2e         | 9.408 kg CO2e           |
| 3 years       | 16.719 kWh         | 3.930 kg CO2e                         | 201.876 kg CO2e        | 28.224 kg CO2e          |
| 5 years       | 27.865 kWh         | 6.550 kg CO2e                         | 336.460 kg CO2e        | 47.04 kg CO2e           |

## Learning outcomes

- You should have an appreciation of how the embodied energy varies with the appliances and devices you use most often
- You should appreciate how embodied energy is amortised over the life of the device, and how this varies with longevity
- You should see how the use phase and the embodied phase vary considerably across devices
- You should be gaining some or enhancing your ‘carbon literacy’.

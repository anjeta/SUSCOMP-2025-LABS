# Mini Project Proposal Consultations

This repo contains templates that you should use for project-related assignments. The slides used during consultation sessions will be uploaded promptly to [Učilnica](https://ucilnica.fri.uni-lj.si/course/view.php?id=5841).

## Project Proposal Template

The file ```01_SUSCOMP_Project_Proposal_Template.pdf``` presents a template for creating the project proposal document. 

You can use the same one, available in LaTeX [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/project-proposal-template/whgtpdghprtb), or you can create your own. Nonetheless, make sure to include all of the sections contained in ```01_SUSCOMP_Project_Proposal_Template.pdf``` in your project proposal.

## Project Update Slides

Use the templates ```02_SUSCOMP_First_Project_Update_Template.pdf```, ```03_SUSCOMP_Second_Project_Update_Template.pdf```, and ```04_SUSCOMP_Third_Project_Update_Template.pdf``` for the project update sessions that will be held during the semester.

## Submissions

Make sure to submit all your contributions to your project's GitHub page, as explained in the introductory slides (link to Učilnica [here](https://ucilnica.fri.uni-lj.si/mod/resource/view.php?id=59907)).

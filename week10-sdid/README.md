# Sustainable Digital Interaction Design (SDID)

In this lab we will dig deeper into **Sustainable Digital Interaction Design (SDID)**, introduced by Priest et al. As preparation for the lab, please read [this article](https://ucilnica.fri.uni-lj.si/mod/resource/view.php?id=60987) upfront.

We will investigate how the authors' *design rubric* — a set of questions intended to guide the design process — can be applied to a **fictional service** under development.

## Fictional Service Under Study: **LifeCache**
*“Never lose a moment. Your life, safely remembered”*

### Service Concept

**LifeCache** is a fictional, AI-assisted personal life archive. It automatically captures, indexes, and stores a person’s daily digital data over their lifetime.

This may include:
- Photos and videos (from phone, wearables, smart glasses)
- Voice snippets (meetings, conversations, ambient notes)
- Location and activity history
- Messages, emails, and documents

The service allows users to search their personal history (e.g. *“When did I last meet Alex?”*), receive automated summaries of their life, and curate a legacy archive that can be passed on after death.

LifeCache is marketed as a way to reduce cognitive burden, preserve identity, and support memory across a lifetime.

## Your Task

You are a **fictional designer** asked to critically evaluate LifeCache using the **Sustainable Digital Interaction Design (SDID)** perspective discussed in the lectures.

There are no right or wrong answers. Your goal is to reason carefully, justify your claims, and reflect on trade-offs.

## Part A – Core SDID Analysis

For each of the questions below (referring to LifeCache), briefly explain why you think the answer is **yes**, **no**, or **“it depends”**.

- **(E1)** Does the design encourage infrastructural expansion or obsolescence?
- **(E2)** Does the design encourage increased infrastructural use?
- **(E3)** Does the design mitigate or reduce infrastructural use in some way?
- **(E4)** Does the design encourage digital waste, or avoidance of it?
- **(E5)** Does the design promote the sharing of infrastructure?

## Part B – Computing Within Limits, Collapse Informatics, and Responsible Design

Answer the following questions about LifeCache concisely but thoughtfully:

- **(R1)** If this service were to be used by all the world’s population, what would the overall environmental impact of the infrastructure be? Can we imagine a future scenario where this would lie within limits imposed by planetary boundaries?

- **(R2)** Is the service able to deal robustly with reduced availability of infrastructure levels?

- **(R3)** Does the business model assume continued growth in infrastructure? If so, what is the risk associated with this?

- **(R4)** What is the societal value of the proposed service, and in what scenarios of restricted infrastructure would this justify the resultant usage?

- **(R5)** Can a restricted version of the service be imagined, and what would its value and infrastructural burden be? In what collapse scenarios would this be deployable?

- **(R6)** Does the service encourage a healthy relationship with digital technology, and avoid promoting inappropriate dependency on the digital infrastructure?

- **(R7)** Is the service in tune with your values, as a designer? Can you say with heart that the benefits it brings humanity are worth the environmental costs of the supporting infrastructure?

## Task Instructions

**Time available:** 1.5 hours

Make sure you have an up-to-date copy of your coursework repository available (`git clone` or `git pull` as needed to ensure you are up to date with the server).

In the `week10-SDID` folder, create a new markdown document called: ```username-week10-labnotes.md``` (where `username` is your username).

### Required Structure

1. In the document, create a subsection titled **Part A**.
2. Within this section, write answers to each of the **E1–E5** questions.
3. Create a subsection titled **Part B**.
4. Within this section, write answers to each of the **R1–R7** questions.
5. Add a subsection titled **Reflections** with a short paragraph discussing:
   - How different constraints (e.g. available energy, materials, span of human attention) must be taken into account when designing a digital service.
   - How differences in potential audience size (e.g. a health app for a specific disease vs. an app for the general population) impact the necessity of designing within limits.

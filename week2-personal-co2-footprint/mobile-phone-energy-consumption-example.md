## Personal CO2 Footprint Estimation

#### Mobile Phone Device - iPhone 15

Estimated usage of the device is:

- 5 hours and 10 minutes daily on average
- 36 hours and 10 minutes (1 day, 12 hours, and 10 minutes) weekly on average
- 1885 hours and 50 minutes (78 days, 13 hours, and 50 minutes) yearly on average

Suppose the battery is 3,349 mAh at ~3.7 V nominal (typical Li-ion). So full energy ≈ 3.349 Ah × 3.7 V ≈ 12.4 Wh. 

Let's suppose also that 30 minutes of standard usage (e.g., browsing, video, and music playing) causes battery drain of 10%. 
This means the average active power is ≈ 1.24 Wh / 0.5 h = ~2.48 W. 
When in idle mode (screen off, standby mode, background tasks), we can expect ≈ 0.13 W.

Total kWh per daily use = (active_power × active_hours) + (idle_power × idle_hours) ≈ 5.17 h × 2.48 W / 1000 + 18.83 h × 0.13 W / 1000 = 0.015 kWh per day.

Therefore, on average, my phone uses 15.27 Wh per day. Given that the battery capacity is 12.4 Wh, this means that I daily use 123.1% of the battery (daily usage of 15.27 Wh / battery capacity of 12.4 Wh * 100). This means that my phone needs at least one top-up charge during the day for such usage.

Now, let's use this information to estimate weekly and yearly consumption:

| Device      | Active power when in use | Power in idle mode | Power when turned off | kWh daily | kWh weekly | kWh yearly |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| iPhone 15   | 2.48 W                   | 1 W                | 0 W                   | 0.015     | 0.107      | 5.573      |


Comparison with other at-home appliances based on the yearly consumption:
- A washing machine uses approximately 80 to 150 kWh per year. 
- A fridge not older than 10 years uses approximately 70 to 120 kWh per year. 
- A TV's annual kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumption varies by wattage, size, and usage, but a 100 W LED TV used for four hours a day might consume around 109.5 kWh per year.
